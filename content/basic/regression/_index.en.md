# Linear Regression

<div class="pagetop-box">
  <p><b>Linear regression</b> is one of the most fundamental methods in machine learning and statistics. It approximates the relationship between inputs (features) and an output (target) with a “line” or “plane” to predict values and understand variable relationships.</p>
</div>

## Why learn linear regression?

- Mathematically simple and interpretable  
- Easy to implement and compute  
- Useful for both prediction and interpretation  
- Foundation for many advanced methods (Ridge/Lasso, GLMs, neural nets, etc.)

---

## What can it do?

- <b>Prediction</b>: e.g., predict sales from advertising, exam score from study time  
- <b>Relationship analysis</b>: coefficients show how outputs change per unit change in inputs  
- <b>Feature importance</b>: identify which variables matter for prediction

## What you’ll learn in this section

1. <b>Least squares</b> — how to fit the best line to data  
2. <b>Ridge and Lasso</b> — regularization to combat overfitting  
3. <b>Robust regression</b> (e.g., Huber) — handling messy data with outliers

## Summary

- Linear regression is “simple yet widely applicable”.  
- Despite its simplicity, it’s heavily used in practice.  
- The concepts here carry over to more advanced models (trees, SVMs, neural nets).
